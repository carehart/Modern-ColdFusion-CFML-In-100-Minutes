# Introduction

Welcome to the wonderful world of dynamic programming with ColdFusion (CFML).  The purpose of this book is to jump start developers into the CFML programming language from a **MODERN** perspective and a focus on best practices, object orientation and tooling.  ColdFusion is not the same as it was 20 years ago, yes it's more than 20 years old! 

It's dynamic, vibrant, modern, fluent, and functional!  Let's begin our adventure into the world of **MODERN** ColdFusion (CFML).
